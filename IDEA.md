Idea: cyberpunk text adventure with programming

- Story:
- Basic gameplay:
    - Interactive text adventure
        - Speak to NPCs
        - Turn-based combat
        - RPG elements: questing, stats
    - Dice-roll based interactions (sneak, etc)
- Programming: interactive world objects. Like Else Heart.Break():
  keys can try to brute-force doors and so on.
